# CCRMA-256A-HW2
256A second homework submission


## Summary

This is an FM synthesis synthesizer.
It is intended to be played with your mouse on a single box on the lower part of it showing a complete octave of musical notes (C to C) 

The sinusoids involved in the synthesis are related through musical intervals expressed in semitones and
tuning intervals expressed in cents.

The user also has access to each of the partial's gain.

A general asdr manages the envelope of the sum of the sinusoids

Some other functionalities include an octave selector and a Main Level fader

## Usage

It is intended to be played with a mouse or two as shown in the video.
Horizontal position of the mouse inside the playable area determines the basefrequency and therefore all of the frequencies by all of the sinusoids
Vertical position of the mouse determine the volume or "velocity" of each note. However this value may change during the course of a note.

## Code Description

The whole project is structured on the MainProcessor class and the MainEditor class.
The MainProcessor will be the holder for all the audio related stuff such as the oscillators, the envelope and obviously the  process block itself.

The MainEditor will be responsible for all the gui and the interaction with the user through sliders and mouseListeners
therefore it will inherit from sliderListener class.

There is a special relation between the processor and the editor.
The editor is created by the processor which during its initialization passes a pointer to the editor object of itself;
therefore the editor has access to all of the processor's public methods and fields and the processor has access to all of
the editors public methods and fields and is actually the holder for the editor taking care of its lifetime.

Take into account that this requires a circular inclusion of the processor's header on the  editor's header and also of the editor's header in the processor's header. To avoid this a dummy class is created on the processor's header for it to be able to create the pointer that will store, during initialization, the address of the editor. This is the main reason for splitting the project into .cpp and .h files in the editor as well as in the processor part of the program

## Example of Use

see this youTube video to check how the synthesizer works and sounds ;)
